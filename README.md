# FSharp.SystemTextJson.Swagger

Swagger settings for [FSharp.SystemTextJson](https://github.com/Tarmil/FSharp.SystemTextJson).
Still experimantal

## Usage
Only replace AddSwaggerGen with AddSwaggerForSystemTextJson
```F#
let builder =  WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)
let fsOptions = JsonFSharpOptions() // setup options here 
//setup usage of JsonFSharpConverter                
builder.Services.AddControllers()
                    .AddJsonOptions(fun opts ->
                        opts.JsonSerializerOptions.Converters.Add(JsonFSharpConverter(fsOptions))) 
// setup usage of SwaggerForSystemTextJson - use instead AddSwaggerGen 
builder.Services.AddSwaggerForSystemTextJson(fsOptions)
        
let app = builder.Build()
        
if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment()) then
      app.UseSwagger() |> ignore
      app.UseSwaggerUI() |> ignore
```
